                <h1>WHO:<h3>CALLING ALL K-5TH GRADERS!</h3>
                <h1>WHAT:<h3>Cub Scouting is fun for the whole family. In Scouting, boys and girls start with their best right now selves and grow into their very best future selves. It’s fun, hands-on learning and achievement that puts kids in the middle of the action and prepares them for today – and for life!</h3>
                <h1>WHEN:<h3>Pack meetings are once month, den meetings are typically twice a month!</h3>
                <h1>WHERE:<h3>Parks, fire station, the mountains, the water! Our adventures take us all over!</h3>
                <h1>WHY:<h3>A Tufts University study released in 2015 found that that “kids in Cub Scouts became significantly more cheerful, helpful, kind, obedient, trustworthy, and hopeful about their future than non-Scouts."</h3>
