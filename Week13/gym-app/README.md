# Chalk Up

I was inspired to do this project from a need in my community. My son is a competitive gymnast and it is difficult to find pertinent information about our sport on the internet. The information that can be found, is spread out in 15 different websites. I decided to create a site that hosts ALL relevant information in a comprehensive website. As of right now it is just a place to shop products. Soon I will create the rest of the features such as a custom API search, links for resources, forums, and videos of routines for parents and coaches to view. Welcome to my site!

## The How
- React/Redux
- CSS
- Javascript
- Node/express
- Supabase

While this was supposed to be a team project, I chose to take this on by myself. I wanted to prove to myself that I could accomplish this and not lean on anyone else for completion. While due to the massive amount of work, I did not get every requirement completed and all of the styling I would have liked done, but I am proud of the work that I put in and how far I have come in this class.

# Log In
From here a user can log in and their information is stored in a database (Supabase)

# Shop
As of right now there are stock photos used for ecommerce store. Soon I will have actual products, created by myself. Even with the stock photos, a user can add, subtract, and have their tax and shipping created for them!

# Color Swatch
To keep the pages looking uniform, I used the following color scheme.

# Future goals
This project does not end with this class. I will implement articles for anything from rips, to grips, to current news about our growing sport. I would also like to implement a craigslist of sorts so a user can find used equipment and uniforms in their area. Last but not least, a custom API. This search will render gyms in a users area that has mens gymnastics teams, their rec or competitive status and path (club, national, elite), and the size of their team. Stay on the lookout and don't forget to CHALK UP!
